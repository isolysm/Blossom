Stupid easy setup for configurations of mods.

The UI is meant to be more modern, and not fit the feel of Minecraft, which might not be for everyone. However, I believe
that the modern elements of the UI will do better with the mods Myosyn provides.

You can see the templates here >>> 

Note that only 1.8.9 requires Essential, and that 1.19 doesn't. In 1.8.9's case, we require the use of Mixin 0.8.5, while
in 1.19's case, it is technically baked in (from my knowledge at least.)
