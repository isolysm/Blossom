A universal cute configuration for both Forge and Fabric. It's also sleek and modern!

This shouldn't install Essential (I think?), so no need to worry about adding like 80 mods. (No hate towards Essential,
just not my cup of tea to add dependency mods)

**THIS IS AN EXPERIMENTAL LIBRARY. Things are going to be very unstable, regardless of whatever happens. I don't recommend that you use this for personal projects.**
