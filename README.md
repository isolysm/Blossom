Stupid easy setup for configurations of mods.

The UI is meant to be more modern, and not fit the feel of Minecraft, which might not be for everyone. However, I believe
that the modern elements of the UI will do better with the mods Myosyn provides.

## NOTICE: 
There is no guarantees that this will work on a modified version of Forge or Fabric. In any of those instances, if the 
GUI breaks, it's not my fault. I do not have the time and resources to support modified versions of these mod loaders.
It is simply impossible as of right now.


You can see the templates here >>> 

Note that only 1.8.9 requires Essential, and that 1.19 doesn't. In 1.8.9's case, we require the use of Mixin 0.8.5, while
in 1.19's case, it is technically baked in (from my knowledge at least.)
